# Module 7: Key Vault

## Task

The source code is available [here](../../../petstore).

Azure Key Vault is a service that offers centralized secrets management, granting comprehensive control over access policies and audit history. In this module, you will practice working with secrets from Azure Key Vault in your App Service or Azure Function application, all without necessitating any code alterations.

**Please complete the following task:**

1. Create a Key Vault instance.
2. Store the Azure Database for PostgreSQL url, username, and password (or connection string) as secrets in the Key Vault.
3. Enable managed identity for the two apps that use the Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
4. Create a Key Vault access policy for the two apps that use the Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
5. Obtain the unique secret URIs associated with the stored database secrets.
6. Update the App Service's application settings to include the Azure Key Vault reference syntax.
7. Reference the stored secret URIs in your apps' settings to securely access the database secrets.
8. (Optional) Utilize Azure CLI to automate resource deployment.

**Definition of Done:**

1. Database credentials are not stored in configuration files or code.
2. A Key Vault is created with secret values assigned for the database url, username, and password (or connection string).
3. Managed identity is enabled for the App Services.
4. A Key Vault access policy is created with the appropriate permissions for the App Services managed identity.
5. A new setting is added to the App Service's application settings, referencing the Key Vault secrets via their unique URLs.
6. The App Service successfully utilizes the configuration settings to access the Key Vault secrets.
